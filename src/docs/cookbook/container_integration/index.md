This example shows how to both how to serve an application HttpHandler using an embedded an HTTP server and to query it using an HTTP client. All server-backend implementations are launched in an identical manner (in 1LOC). Additionally, server instances can be customised using classes available in the implementation JARs - in the case of Jetty, the application is mounted using the `asServlet()` extension method into the Jetty container.
